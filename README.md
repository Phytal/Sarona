### Summary 
An Android grade-fetching app made with Kotlin. The app fetches student grades from the HomeAccessCenter (HAC) and displays them in a simple format.
### Further Details
Data collection is powered by my [HAC API made with Python+Flask](https://github.com/Phytal/HomeAccessCenter-Flask-API) and is stored locally on the device, allowing for offline usage.
